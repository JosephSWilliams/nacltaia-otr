nacltaia-otr:
  provides authenticated and encrypted messages
  and protects recepients from forgeries, replay
  attacks, and other shenannigans through the
  protocol of IRC in a chroot environment.

  the chosen primitives for PM are:

  taia64 + curve25519xsalsa20poly1305 + base91a

  the selected primitives provide authenticated,
  encrypted messages from a sender (seckey), to
  a receiver (pubkey). the protocol protects
  receivers from forgeries and replay attacks.

  the chosen primitives for CHAT are:

  taia64 + crypto_secretbox_xsalsa20poly1305 + base91a

  the selected primitives provide authenticated,
  encrypted messages for senders to receivers
  with a shared seckey. the protocol protects
  receivers from forgeries and replay attacks.

  IMHO PM/CHAT messages are usually between 0 and 128
  bytes length. nacltaia-otr automatically pads each
  message in 128 byte blocks. in example, the messages
  "Hi, :-)" and "How are you?" will result in the same
  size 128 byte ciphertext. messages greater than 128
  bytes will be padded to meet the full 128 byte block.
  the tradeoff here is a small additional overhead for
  considerably stronger security.

  before nacltaia-otr begins handling incoming and
  outgoing remote data, it locks itself into a chroot
  jail and throws aways the key. this isn't just an
  option for security, it's the only way to run
  nacltaia-otr.

  the chosen encryption schemes of nacltaia-otr will
  never violate your repudiability. sending ciphertext
  through nacltaia-otr cannot substantiate a sender as
  the source of a message anymore than sending the same
  message in plaintext. it does this while still
  preventing third-party forgeries.

  IRC messages may often contain binary encoding. this
  can allow an attacker to tamper with internal
  mechanisms in some IRC clients, often without the
  user's knowledge. in worst cases it can even allow
  an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's
  machine. nacltaia-otr automatically purges all binary
  encoding before it makes it to the IRC client.

  nacltaia-otr provides perfect forward secrecy through
  the use of session keys. this maintains that even if
  your private key is compromised, no previous message
  can be decrypted.

  much thanks to Ivo Smits for help with 64bit
  platforms and valuable insight on some strange
  functionalities of the IRC protocol.
